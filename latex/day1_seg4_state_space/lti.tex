Linear Time-Invariant Differential Equations
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Differential Equations
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Linear: Polynomial differential operators are linear:
\[p(D)[af+bg]= ap(D)f+bp(D)g\]
 \item Time-Invariant means the coefficients are constant.
 \item Homogeneous solution of corresponding state equation is a matrix exponential.  (More on that later when we discuss the state transition matrix.)
\end{itemize}
